# Modified-Space-Invaders-Game

## About
This is my version of Space Invaders that I created in my App Development class during my senior year of high school (2018-2019).

This is a modified version of the game, NOT a replica. The rules and game style has been altered to show my creativity and the
final product that I envisioned.


In order to play the game itself, an executable JAR file is needed. I recommend running the program in Eclipse (Later the version the better).

This was done in collaboration with my App Developement teacher, Mr. Fahrenbacher of Nile Township West High School, who provided the source code and 
the backbone of the project.

(Before my intervention, the executable JAR file would consist of only one alien and a player with the functionality of only going left. Rest of the features
were implemented by me.)

## Important note

The actual program and project was completed towards the end of 2018. This is just a reupload of the source code since I lost
record of the previous one. Feel free to enjoy the game and make your own version if you want! Have fun!
